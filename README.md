# From Quantum Computing to Quantum Machine Learning
Official repository for everything presented in Leonardo Placidi Data Science Master's Thesis - October 2021. 
<br>
I am a Qiskit Advocate and IBM Certified Quantum Developer.
<br>
It is acknowledged the material available on <a href="https://qiskit.org/" target="_blank">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://pennylane.ai/" target="_blank">PennyLane</a>. Some codes, for their simplicity or for the common methods implemented, are based on the above resources quoted or are developed after studying the official implementations. <br>

These codes complete the main text of the Master's Thesis and represent a first work in Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning by Leonardo Placidi.

# How to run

For the sake of anyone that wants to learn and run quantum experiments I decided to provide everything in the form of jupyter notebooks. The reader can run this most preferably on Google Colab or on the IBM Quantum Experience.

# What you find
Every free file is named accordingly to the chapter it belongs in the text. <br>
Regarding the folders:
* *Final Experiments*: Here the reader may find all the notebooks containing the round of experiments discussed in the last Chapter of the thesis text.
* *IBMChallengesPlacidi*: the reader may find here the original solutions authored by me for the IBM Global Quantum Challenge 2021 and for the Qiskit Summer School 2021. There are also the files regarding the Qiskit Africa Challenge 2021, in which I was a mentor in the period 8-21 September 2021. The solutions were already discosed as part of the Qiskit team, but the reader may find anyhow some insights and implemented solutions.
