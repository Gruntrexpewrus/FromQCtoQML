It is acknowledged the material available on <a href="https://qiskit.org/" target="_blank">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://pennylane.ai/" target="_blank">PennyLane</a>. Some codes, for their simplicity or for the common methods implemented, are based on the above resources quoted or are developed after studying the official implementations.<br>

These codes complete the main text of the Master Thesis and represent a first work in Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning by Leonardo Placidi.

# How to run

For the sake of anyone that wants to learn and run quantum experiments I decided to provide everything in the form of jupyter notebooks. The reader can run this most preferably on Google Colab or on the IBM Quantum Experience.

# What you find
Every free file is named accordingly to the chapter it belongs in the text. <br>
Regarding the folders:
* *ExperimentsPennyLane*: Here the reader may find all the notebooks containing the round of experiments discussed in the last Chapter of the thesis text. In the text is referred as *FinalExperiments*.
* *2021-QiskitAfricaQChallenge_Mentor*: the reader finds here the notebooks for the Africa events mentored by me (period 8-21 September 2021). The solution notebooks features implemented author's solutions (I had access well before the challenge to prepare for mentoring the students) along some proposed personal solutions.
* *2021-QiskitGlobalChallenge_Competitor*: the reader may find here the original solutions authored by me for the IBM Global Quantum Challenge 2021 where I resulted as a top scorer globally. For some problems during the event the time limit was taken out, so the top score was ten shared with a series of other competitors that reached the same result.
* *2021-QiskitSummerSchool_Student*: the reader may find here the original solutions authored by me for the Qiskit Summer School of 2021. There are 5 labs and, reaching the maximum grade, I was awarded an excellence diploma for the school.
